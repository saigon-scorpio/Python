Part 1
Define a class called Point. A Point represents a position in 2 dimensional space, defined by an x and a y coordinate (no need to define any methods yet).

Instantiate a Point object representing the origin (0,0):

Part 2
Re-write your Point definition and instantiation of Point to make use of an __init__() method:

Part 3
Add a method to Point called display_point() that displays Point information in the form: (x, y). Then call display_point() to print a Point object.

Part 4
Modify display_point() to implement the special function __str__(). Then print a Point object.

Part 5
Add a predicate method to Point called equals() that accepts another Point object and determines if it has the same x and y values as the calling object (think self). Then call equals() to determine if 2 Point objects store equivalent data.
