Practice Problem 

For the following problems, we will need to download a file: words.txt. This file contains 113,809 official crossword words, one per line. Using words.txt, write a program with the following functionality:

- A function called open_input_file() that opens words.txt for reading and returns the file object associated with words.txt
- A function called close_file() that accepts the file object as an argument and closes the file
- A function called first_five_words() that displays the first 5 words of the file. 

Try to display the words one on each line, without an extra newline between the words like:
aa
aah
aahed
